PS: If by mistake, as I did the first time, and you need to clear your whitelist or blacklist, use ([doc](https://docs.pi-hole.net/database/gravity/)):

#### ⚠ You will not be able to undo, back up first ⚠

To Whitelist
> sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "delete from domainlist where type=0;"

To blacklist
> sudo sqlite3 /etc/pihole/gravity.db "delete from domainlist where type=1;"
